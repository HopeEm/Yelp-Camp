# Yelp-Camp
We as a group plan to build a tourism website for our software engineering
project. This website would contain a database of information of various
tourist camping places. This website would give out the basic details of the
camping site, the interesting points and sites in the camp site. There would
be a provision provided where users an register or login to the database. The
registered users can add their comments about the particular camp site they
visited. The registered users can also add a new camping location not
previously available in the database. The domain of the camping sites would
be all across the world. We aim to achieve this by using the markup
languages HTML,CSS ad javascript. We are also thinking of providing a sign
up page for guides. These guides can register on our site and then the users
can book their services on selected date and time.
